# Number Guessing Game ðŸŽ¯

A terminal-based Python game that challenges the player to guess a randomly generated number based on difficulty level. Built to reinforce core programming concepts and demonstrate clean, modular design.

---

## Project Overview

This game includes:

- Difficulty selection (`Easy`, `Medium`, `Hard`)
- Input validation for guesses and replay prompts
- Dynamic range control based on difficulty
- Attempt tracking and feedback
- Replay loop for multiple rounds
- Bracketed output formatting for visual clarity

---

## Why I Built This

I built this project to practice control flow, input handling, and modular function design. It reflects my own learning curve and attention to detail, with a focus on user experience and clean logic.

---
## Challenges Faced

- Handling invalid inputs and enforcing range constraints
- Structuring replay logic without redundancy
- Maintaining consistent output formatting
- Avoiding hardcoded values and making the game dynamic

---

## Improvements Made

- Modularized input and replay logic
- Added dynamic difficulty scaling
- Refined feedback messages for clarity
- Standardized output using bracketed formatting
- Removed redundant code and tightened control flow
